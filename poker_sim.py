Refactoring reflection:

I did a lot of refactoring in this project.  I often wrote functions a certain way,
and then as I was writing other code that would use those functions, I figured a better
way to rewrite them and make them more reusable, efficient, and understandable.  There were
a couple of times where I would write a function with multiple lines of code.  Then, I would go
back and remember a method or shorter way of producing the same output, and my code looked much neater and
easier to read after it.  It also made tracing through other functions a lot easier.
